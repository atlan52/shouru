## Methodology

Records extracted from public posts on locally-dominant platforms by an
LLM (Claude Sonnet 4.6) constrained to the
[`IncomeRecord`](../../extract/schema.py) schema. Local-currency amounts
are converted to USD/year via a dated FX snapshot
(see `extract.fx`); period normalization (hour/day/week/month/year) is
performed downstream of the LLM. Income brackets are country-specific
USD/yr thresholds defined in `config.COUNTRY_BRACKETS`. Earning
mechanisms are picked from a closed list documented in
[docs/MECHANISMS.md](../../docs/MECHANISMS.md). Counts here reflect
sampled posts, not population statistics — interpret accordingly.
